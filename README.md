# Purpose #

The close prices for the first asset on the list are also shown.

# Usage #

To use the bot, send it a direct message on Discord or post in any channel the bot has access to on a Discord server that the bot is in. The message should conform to the following guidelines.

Default settings (365 days, using tickers `X:BTCUSD`, `X:ETHUSD`, `X:XMRUSD`):
```
!stonks
```
will produce:
![example 1](pics/!stonks.png)

Default settings with user-defined number of days:
```
!stonks <number of days>
```
for example:
```
!stonks 3
```
will produce:
![example 2](pics/!stonks_3.png)
```
!stonks 14
```
will produce:
![example 3](pics/!stonks_14.png)

Custom input:
```
!stonks <number of days> <tickers with spaces>
```
for example:
```
!stonks 365 X:BTCUSD GOOG NVDA AAPL
```
will produce:
![example 4](pics/!stonks_365_X-BTCUSD_GOOG_NVDA_AAPL.png)

> [!TIP]  
> In terms of [tickers](https://polygon.io/quote/tickers), mixing cryptocurrencies and stocks is allowed!
