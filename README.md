> Discord bot that creates price comparison charts for cryptocurrencies and stocks using real-time market data.

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Deploy to Railway (Recommended):**
1. Fork this repository ‚Üí Get [Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) & [Polygon.io API Key](https://polygon.io/)
2. `railway up` ‚Üí Set environment variables in Railway dashboard ‚Üí Invite bot to server

**Run Locally:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aljazfrancic/stonks-bot.git
cd stonks-bot && ./scripts/setup.sh
# Edit .env with your API keys, then: python bot.py
```

## üîß Setup

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
POLYGON=your_polygon_api_key
```

**Scripts:**
- `./scripts/setup.sh` - Quick local setup
- `./scripts/deploy.sh` - Deploy to Railway

## ü§ñ Deployment

- [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md)

## üîÑ CI/CD Behavior

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically updates the stonks images every hour. **Smart Commit Management:**

- **If the last commit is a chore commit** (autopublish): Automatically amends the existing commit instead of creating new ones
- **If the last commit is not a chore commit**: Creates a new commit as usual

This keeps the git history clean by consolidating all autopublish updates into single commits, preventing the repository from being cluttered with hundreds of individual chore commits.

## üìñ Usage

> [!NOTE]
> The following graphs are automagically updated via GitHub Actions, so we're looking at the latest data available wihtout paying any subscriptions.

To use the bot, send it a direct message on Discord or post in any channel the bot has access to on a Discord server that the bot is in. The message should conform to the following guidelines.

> [!TIP]
> You can mix stock and cryptocurrency [tickers](https://polygon.io/quote/tickers) in the same command.

Default settings (365 days, using tickers `X:BTCUSD`, `X:ETHUSD`, `X:XMRUSD`, `X:AVAXUSD`):
```
!stonks
```
will produce:
![example 1](pics/!stonks.png)

Default settings with user-defined number of days:
```
!stonks <number of days>
```
for example:
```
!stonks 3
```
will produce:
![example 2](pics/!stonks_3.png)

```
!stonks 14
```
will produce:
![example 3](pics/!stonks_14.png)

Custom input:
```
!stonks <number of days> <tickers with spaces>
```
for example:
```
!stonks 365 X:BTCUSD GOOG NVDA AAPL
```
will produce:
![example 4](pics/!stonks_365_X-BTCUSD_GOOG_NVDA_AAPL.png)

## üìù TODO

- [ ] Combine CoinGecko and Polygon tickers
- [ ] Overall code quality improvements
